# USE CASE: 2

## Problem Statement:
Business Context:
The executive team at our organization required a comprehensive and insightful sales report to make informed decisions. The source data was available in the AdventureWorks Sales Sample Excel file, which could be accessed here. To achieve this, we needed to utilize Power BI desktop and the Power BI service for publishing.

## Challenges:

Importing data without relying on auto detection of relationships might have led to inaccuracies in the report.
Establishing proper relationships between queries was crucial for accurate and meaningful insights.
The team needed to acquire skills in dimensional modeling and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for a robust solution.
## Solution:
Importing Data:

Opened Power BI desktop and imported data from the AdventureWorks Sales Sample Excel file.
Instead of relying on auto detection of relationships, we carefully inspected the data and decided how tables should be related.
Building Relationships:

Utilized Power BI desktop to manually establish relationships between queries.
Paid special attention to the key fields that linked different tables and ensured their relationships were defined appropriately.
Skill Acquisition:

Acquired skills in dimensional modeling to better understand and represent the relationships between various data entities.
Familiarized the team with DAX for creating custom calculations and expressions to enhance the analytical capabilities of the report.
