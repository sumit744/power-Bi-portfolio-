# USE CASE: 2

## Problem Statement:
Business Context:
The executive team at our organization required a comprehensive and insightful sales report to make informed decisions. The source data was available in the AdventureWorks Sales Sample Excel file, which could be accessed here. To achieve this, we needed to utilize Power BI desktop and the Power BI service for publishing.

## Challenges:

Importing data without relying on auto detection of relationships might have led to inaccuracies in the report.
Establishing proper relationships between queries was crucial for accurate and meaningful insights.
The team needed to acquire skills in dimensional modeling and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for a robust solution.
## Solution:
Importing Data:

Opened Power BI desktop and imported data from the AdventureWorks Sales Sample Excel file.
Instead of relying on auto detection of relationships, we carefully inspected the data and decided how tables should be related.
Building Relationships:

Utilized Power BI desktop to manually establish relationships between queries.
Paid special attention to the key fields that linked different tables and ensured their relationships were defined appropriately.
Skill Acquisition:

Acquired skills in dimensional modeling to better understand and represent the relationships between various data entities.
Familiarized the team with DAX for creating custom calculations and expressions to enhance the analytical capabilities of the report.

# USE CASE: 3

## Problem Statement:

**Business Context:**
The organization required an insightful Wind Power Dashboard, utilizing data from the source available [here](https://www.chooseenergy.com/news/article/best-worst-ranked-states-wind-power/). To achieve this, we needed to leverage Power BI desktop or service along with Excel.

**Challenges:**
1. Creating two pages with the same design, one with Field Parameters and one without, was essential for providing flexibility in data analysis.
2. The successful publication of the report on the Power BI service was a critical step in ensuring accessibility for the team.
3. Acquiring exhaustive skills in using Power BI's inbuilt functionality was necessary to develop a comprehensive and effective dashboard.

### Solution:

**Creating Pages:**
- Utilized Power BI desktop to create two pages with identical designs, showcasing the difference between having and not having Field Parameters.
- Explored Power BI's inbuilt functionality to design a user-friendly and informative dashboard.

**Publishing Report:**
- Successfully published the report on the Power BI service, making it accessible to the team for collaborative and remote use.

**Skill Acquisition:**
- Acquired exhaustive skills in utilizing Power BI's inbuilt functionality, enhancing our ability to create dynamic and interactive visualizations.

### Dashboard Demonstration:

**Page Design:**
1. **With Field Parameter:** Showcased the page where users could interact with field parameters to dynamically adjust and analyze wind power data.
2. **Without Field Parameter:** Presented the alternative page without field parameters, emphasizing a static view of the data.

**Power BI Service:**
- Demonstrated the published report on the Power BI service, highlighting its accessibility and collaborative features for team members.

**Team Demo:**
- Conducted a comprehensive demonstration to the team, showcasing the different aspects of the Wind Power Dashboard.
- Discussed the design choices, the importance of field parameters, and the benefits of utilizing Power BI's inbuilt functionality for creating effective and visually appealing dashboards.

### Conclusion:

The completion of the Wind Power Dashboard project enabled the team to analyze and visualize wind power data effectively. The utilization of Power BI's inbuilt functionality, along with the creation of pages with and without Field Parameters, provided a versatile tool for the team's data-driven decision-making process. The successful publication on the Power BI service ensured easy access and collaboration among team members.
